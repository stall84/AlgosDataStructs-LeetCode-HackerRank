/**
 * @description To explore the concepts of recursion, We'll write a function that will call a helper function (find) to determine the sequences of arithmetic 
 *              that equals the @param target number. Following these rules: Start at 1, and use any combination of adding 5 or multiplying by 3. 
 *              So for a target of 13, we would output (1 * 3) + 5 + 5 . For a target of 15 we would output null (not attainable starting from 1)

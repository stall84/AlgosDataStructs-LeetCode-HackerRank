# Linked List Notes
<br/>
<hr/>

### Fundamentals
- Unlike conventional array's where each element is stored side-by-side to it's neighbors in memory, Linked Lists can have nodes fragmented all over the memory space.
- The first node in a linked list is called the *HEAD*
- Each node has a *NEXT* property which is it's _pointer_
- The last node in a LL points to *NONE*

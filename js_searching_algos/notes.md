### Linear Search
- The simplest and most straightforward way of searching for the existence of an element in an array (or any datastructure or primitive for that matter) is a linear search.
- Literally looking at each element, one by one, for the target element. In some cases this is often the only (therefore the best/most efficient) method to use. (i.e. when no sorting available)
- Linear Search is used _under the hood_ by Javascript for the following methods: **indexOf(), includes(), find(), findIndex()**
